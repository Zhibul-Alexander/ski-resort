    "directions": "In Gudauri, we run a rental focused on quality and service. Not just \"handing out a set\", but fitting you with gear so you feel comfortable, safe, and enjoy every run. We also have 2 shops, so pickup and return is easier — choose the location closer to you.\n\nThe selection is big: skis, snowboards, boots, bindings, kids' sets — all matched by size and skill level. Want a calm, comfortable ride? We'll choose something softer and easier. Need speed, control, and a more \"sporty\" feel? We'll find the right setup for your style. Before you head out, we'll adjust the bindings, check boot fit, and explain the key points — clear and to the point.\n\nIf you want to \"get everything at once\", that's easy too. Along with the main set, we offer clothing and accessories: jackets and pants, helmets, masks/goggles, gloves — so you're ready for any day in the mountains.\n\nWe also have instructors. If it's your first time on the slopes — they'll help you build a solid base and feel confident. If you already ride — they'll show you how to improve technique and ski safer.\n\nWe want rental to feel like care and convenience: you come in, get fitted fast, go ride — and think only about enjoying the mountains.",
