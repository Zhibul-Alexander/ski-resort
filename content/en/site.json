    "description": "Popular ski resort in Georgia in the Greater Caucasus Mountains, approximately 120–130 km from Tbilisi, on the Georgian Military Road. There are slopes for different levels — from beginner training to confident skiing, as well as large areas near the slopes for freeride enthusiasts. The resort is compact and convenient: accommodation, cafes and services are usually located near the lifts. In winter, road conditions can change due to weather, so it's better to plan your trip with extra time."
